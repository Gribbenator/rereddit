## Rereddit

This is a clone of Reddit. I implemented the frontend in JavaScript, Vue.js and Buefy. I did not develop the backend. It was develoepd by the COMP2041 course staff (I did not take this course).

## API

The backend server will be where you'll be getting your data. Don't touch the code in the backend; although we've provided the source, 
it's meant to be a black box. Final testing will be done with our own backend so don't _assume_ any single piece of data will be there. Use the instructions provided in the backend/README.md
to get it started.

For the full docs on the API, start the backend server and navigate to the root (very likely to be `localhost:5000`, the exact url will be printed when you run the backend, see backend/README.md for more info). You'll see all the endpoints, descriptions and expected responses.
